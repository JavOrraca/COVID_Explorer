# COVID_Explorer

This dashboard is a work in progress and meant as an exercise for R Markdown and flexdashboard. The forecasts are basic univariate projections that do not consider multiple variables in the COVID-19 crisis.

**Data soures:**

 - The primary data source is the [Corona Data Scraper](https://coronadatascraper.com)
 - Corona Data Scraper pulls COVID-19 Coronavirus case data from over 115 local and international verified sources, finds the corresponding GeoJSON features, and adds population data.
 - Inspiration for this dashboard came from Rami Krispin's [coronavirus](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) R package and GitHub page
 
**R Packages:**
 
 - tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, stringr, lubridate, purrr)
 - maps
 - flexdashboard
 - wppExplorer
 - plotly
 - tsibble
 - fable
 - feasts
